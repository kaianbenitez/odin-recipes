Hello! This will be my first project in TheOdin Porject Curriculum.

I will start to build a website using HTML and CSS. 

The website will contains food recipes. 

I already learned the basics of CLI and how to navigate within it. I also learned Git and how important a version control systems are.

I hope to showcase what I have learned in the first chapter of TheOdinProject.
